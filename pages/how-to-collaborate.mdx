# How to Collaborate

First of all, **thank you** for your interest in this project. Here are some things to consider before
submitting to this repository.

## [Point [01](#point-01)]

- The main purpose of this repository is to provide tips and guidelines to help you and your colleagues in your daily workflow, not to prove yourself or how much you know about something.

## [Point [02](#point-02)]

- Write about things that you are familiar with. The purpose of this is not to gather information for the sake of it but to bring to the table those practices that we are already using on the projects we work on and to discuss them.

## [Point [03](#point-03)]

- Everything we upload here will be open to reviews, modifications and further extension by other collaborators.

## [Point [04](#point-04)]

- When providing guidelines, focus on the why. When we approach a problem, knowing the reason why we do things is key when it comes to evaluating if a solution is the more appropiate one. Sometimes we apply certain patterns because they are proven to work well in many situations. However, we often do it out of familiarity, convenience or to keep the consistency throughout and between projects.

## [Point [05](#point-05)]

- Try to point the pitfalls and handicaps of what you are proposing. No solution or technology is perfect. Are there any cases in which the topic you are writing about should not be used? If it is something complicated, is it always worth it? Is it hard to maintain? Does it impair readability? Makes code simpler but at the expense of performance?

## [Point [06](#point-06)]

- Dare to make mistakes. You should be careful about not giving wrong information; however, we all make mistakes and obvious blunders are going to be easily found and corrected, and you will learn about something that you may have been doing wrong.

## [Point [07](#point-07)]

- Use examples as often as you can. They make everything clearer. It may be useful to link those projects where you use
  the concepts you are writing about here, provided they are accessible.

## [Point [08](#point-08)]

- Try to make it understandable for developers that are not proficient in the field you are writing about. Your contributions may be read by devs that, despite their experience, may be unfamiliar with the concepts you are covering.

## [Point [09](#point-09)]

- Do not feel forced to write here. It is totally okay if you just come here to read and learn. Though, as Z1 developer, if you do, you may register the time you dedicate to it as a productive time.

## [Point [10](#point-10)]
- Share your contributions as a way to get feedback and encourage others to collaborate. As Z1 developer, you can do so through our Slack dev channels.
