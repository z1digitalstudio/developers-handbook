## [Introduction](#introduction) 

The aim of this page is to give some guidance when bootstrapping a new project. Each project has its own needs. The requirements of configuration might vary from project to project. On top of that, the methodology used to create and configure new projects is in continuous change and adaptation to new solutions and recommendations.

However, this might be useful for those who don't even know where to start.

Remember to keep on researching for standards and recommendations, and reach out to anyone in the Z1 team for support in case you need it ü§ù
