# Setup your IDE

We recommend you using [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/webstorm/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)



## Extensions
When you're setting your IDE these are some of the extensions that you may consider installing. This are the ones used and recommended by the Z1 team:

- **Px to rem**. This extension is essential to the front end workflow at Z1 to translate our designs (made with pixels) to rem. It enables you with a shortcut for easily converting values without any additional calculations.
	-  Vscode:  https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sainoba.px-to-rem

- **Prettier**. Prettier is a core tool we include in all our projects to aggree on code formatting style and not obsessing over it. 

	After install it, you will need to set it up so it only works when it detects a prettier configuration file. That way we'll avoid to unintentionally change the format of a codebase. In order to do that, set `prettier.requireConfig` to `true` and `editor.formatOnSave` to true.

	Note that now you'll always need a `.prettierrc` file with at least an empty object on it (so it will use all default rules) to format your files.

- **ESLint**. Eslint is the other essential tool in our belt for enforcing code style. The difference with Prettier is that, while Prettier is focused on syntax, ESLint is focused on the behavior of our code. You can add the ESLint extension to highlight errors and provide you with additional information.

	Likewise Prettier, you can add some configurations to your settings to fix problems on save:

	```
		"eslint.validate": ["javascript", "typescript", "typescriptreact"],
		"editor.codeActionsOnSave": { "source.fixAll.eslint": true }
	```
