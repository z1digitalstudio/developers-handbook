# Z1 Developers Handbook

## Introduction

Opinionated style guide for syntax, conventions, best practices and technical decisions for teams by [@z1digitalstudio](//twitter.com/z1digitalstudio). These rules are based on our development experience [building more than 50 products](https://z1.digital/work) in the last 5 years.

**If you are a client or you are interested in working with us**  
As developers, we understand that your technical team need more than a [portfolio](https://z1.digital/work) for being sure that we are the best option.

**If you are a developer interested in joining our team**  
We have been in your situation before and we know that sometimes is not enough only with the [career page](https://z1.digital/careers). You are a developer and you want to know more about code and best practices.

**If you are a Z1 developer**  
We hope that this repo makes your coding easier on a daily basis.
