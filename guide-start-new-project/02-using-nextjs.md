## [Using NextJs](#using-nextjs) 

###### [Step [001](#step-new001)] Initial Setup

We used [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) React Framework in our project. 

**Manual  setup** If you want to use it for your project we recommend following the [manual setup](https://nextjs.org/docs#manual-setup) guide to do it. 

In case you use this option, take into account that the pages directory should be located inside src directory (create it if you haven't done that yet). Also, don't forget that the index file you need to add inside pages directory should be index.tsx instead of index.js if you are following this configuration guide **using Typescript**.

**Quick start**. Alternatively, you can use [this guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript) provided by Next.js to initialize a project with Typescript. It will install Next.js, Typescript and ESLint. It will also add config files such as `.gitignore` and `tsconfig.json.`


###### [Step [002](#step-new002)] Scripts
Once Next has been added to the project, the `package.json` file will contain some scripts. You might want to modify them or even add some more later. 

In our case, we renamed dev one as start (and removed the line for the default start one). We also modified build one to "build": "next build && next export‚Äù. The reason is because we use Next without server-side rendering and we only want to create a static page.

````json
"scripts": { 
	"build": "next build && next export", 
	"start": "next dev" 
},

````


###### [Step [003](#step-new003)] Typescript
If you opted for the manual setup, you would need to install typescript:

````
yarn add --dev typescript @types/react 
yarn plugin import typescript 
yarn tsc --init
````

Open the `tsconfig.json` file and edit it with an appropriate configuration taking into account your project needs. In our case, we decided to keep the Strict Type-Checking Options and Additional Checks. We removed the rest of the code and cleaned up the file a bit. This is how our file ended up looking like:

````json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "alwaysStrict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "module": "commonjs",
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    // Temporarily disable until Next can build with this new syntax
    "noImplicitOverride": false,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noImplicitThis": true,
    "noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature": true,
    "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "strict": true,
    "strictBindCallApply": true,
    "strictFunctionTypes": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "strictPropertyInitialization": true,
    "lib": ["dom", "dom.iterable", "esnext"],
    "allowJs": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "jsx": "preserve"
  },
  "include": ["next-env.d.ts", "additional.d.ts", "**/*.tsx", "**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
````


###### [Step [003](#step-new003)] Start Next App
Create a `src` directory, a `pages` directory inside it, and an `index.tsx` file inside the last one. You can fill this file with the following code:

````tsx
function HomePage(): JSX.Element {
  return <div>Welcome to Next.js!</div>;
}

export default HomePage;
````

The last (_optional_) step is to create a `next.config.js` file where we will specify that we want to disable ESLint during builds, as we will configure later on GitHub actions to have its own lint step. This will save time and resources during the build.

````js
module.exports = {
	eslint: { 
		ignoreDuringBuilds: true, 
	}, 
};
````

Now, you can run yarn start üöÄ
