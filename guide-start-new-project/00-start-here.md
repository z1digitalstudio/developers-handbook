## [Introduction](#introduction) 

The aim of this page is to give some guidance when creating a new project. Each project has its own needs and requirements and its configuration, among other things, might be different from other projects. Additionally, the methodology used to create and configure new projects is in continuous change and adaptation to new solutions and recommendations.

However, this might be useful for those who don't even know where to start.

Remember to search for standards and recommendations and reach out to anyone in the Z1 team for support in case you need it ü§ù
