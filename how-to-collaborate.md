# How to Collaborate

// ToDo Review English grammar

First of all, thank you for your interest in making this project group. Here are some things to consider before
submitting to this repository.

**1** The main purpose of this repository is to provide tips and guidelines to help you and your workmates in their daily workflow, not proving yourself or how much you know about something.

**2** Write about things that you are familiar with. The purpose of this is not to gather information for the sake of it but to bring to the table those practices that we are already using on the projects we work and discuss them.

**3** Everything we upload here is open to be reviewed, modified and extended by other collaborators.

**4** When providing guidelines, focus on the why. Knowing the reason why we do things is key when it comes to evaluate if a solution is the more appropiate one when we are approaching a problem. Sometimes we apply certain patterns because they are proven to work well in many situations. However, we often do it out of familiarity, convenience or to keep the consistency within or between projects.

**5** Try to point the pitfalls and handicaps of what you are proposing. No solution or technology is perfect. Are there any cases the topic you are writing about should not be used? If it is something complicated, does it always worth? It is hard to maintain? Does it put a toll on code readability?

**6** Dare to make mistakes. You should be careful about not giving wrong information. However, we all make mistakes and obvious blunders are going to be easily found out and corrected, and you will learn about something that you may have been doing wrong before.

**7** Use examples as often as you can. They make everything clearer.

**8** Try to make it understandable for developers that are not proficient in the field you are writing about in. Your contributions may be read by devs that, despite of their experience, may be unfamiliar with the concepts you are writing about.

**9** Do not feel obligated to write here. It is totally okay if you enter here for just reading and learning.
